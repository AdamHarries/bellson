An experiment in automated swing music BPM detection using neural network techniques. Named for one of Duke Ellington's most talented drummers (and Pearl Bailey's husband), Louie Bellson.

Bellson is designed as a companion tool for the `Ellington` tool, and is part of the ellington-project. There are some features of bellson (e.g. training) that require that the user have an ellington-generated libraryfile. 

Please get in touch if you're interested in using this, and having trouble getting it working.
